[Yeehaa](About.md), alias of [Jan Hein Hoogstad](About.md), believes the way we build *ecosystems* is broken.

15 years ago he was an established *philosophy professor* and on the side a passionate developer.

These two worlds are both very free thinking and at the same time collaborating in a very structured way to achieve a goal or reach a strong conclusion, with little to no hierarchy.

However when it came to the *ecosystem* that was supposed to empower students to learn better, he was very disappointed.

* Students had to follow the rules, classes and assignments.
* Most professors were not willing to change the rules to adapt to different times.
* And a strong centralized hierarchy brought change to a complete Mexican standoff, where none of the faculties was willing to be the first.

Unfortunately also many companies, still expect innovation and change In the same way.


How are our *ecosystems* supposed to thrive, if the way they are set up, is broken?


[Yeehaa](About.md) is an [Ecosystem Architecture](../Ideas/Ecosystem%20Architecture.md). He helps organizations that are dependent on multiple stakeholders to create high-trust networks capable of generating thriving innovations.


* He starts with a big common vision and identifies win-wins.
* He will run around aligning all the stakeholders.
* Finally he will help you set up a playbook and instill small yet exciting new habits, the rest is up to you.


* Instead of approaching things hierarchically your team can start change 1 small experiment at the time.
* The people that do want to get going, can easily go.
* The rules do not become a goal, but the common goal will determine what rules make sense for everyone.
