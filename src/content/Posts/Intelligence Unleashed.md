  Supervised and unsupervised learning are two branches of machine learning.  But these terms designate much more than a mere technical distinction.  This post explains that unsupervised learning promises a new way to think about  intelligence in general: Human and otherwise.

While the mechanical phonograph cylinder was invented in 1877, it took almost an entire century before Edison's device was released from [His Master's Voice](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/04/28/his-masters-voice-the-origins-of-the-famous-jack-russell-terrier-nipper-the-canine-advertising-icon-for-many-gramophone-companies/). Sound Engineers and musicians were so endeared with the [pipe
dream](https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1947.593) of [High Fidelity](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/high-fidelity-high-definition1.htm), that they completely overlooked the creative possibilities that the gramophone also offered. 

Once Pandora was out off the box – and no, it weren't [John, Paul, George & Ringo](https://www.unifiedmanufacturing.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1.jpg) that released her – music would never be the same again. Sound engineers projected the recording arts beyond the spatial and temporal boundaries of reality. Or, to put it in the lingo of Sun Ra, Music was no longer earth-bound; space became the place.

It is high time to free the [discourse](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generating-word-cloud-python/) of Artificial Intelligence from its shackles of fidelity too. Technically, the field has been ready to do so for quite a while. Unsupervised Machine Learning is the branch of machine learning that does not need a human baseline to improve its findings, but rather recognizes patterns that are beyond the scope of human cognition and categorization.

Stubborn creatures as they are, however, humans are often reluctant to accept that their intelligence is surpassed by their own creation. Instead, they rather hold on to their primitive and biased opinions and observations. This post argues that this should change.

Supervised learning is the most commonly used branch of machine learning. The supervision in its name, designates the practice of developing a human baseline. This baseline is operationalized in the [feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_feedback) loop between the training data and loss function. For those not familiar with this process and these terms, I'll briefly explain it.

Like most unborns, a machine learning model knows nothing about the world at its inception. To improve, it needs to be taught right from wrong, or at least better from worse. And who better to teach her than it's [creator](https://youtu.be/YqvCptqhHfs)? Right? 

In order to train a model, programmers feed a model a set of problems with known answers ([labels](https://youtu.be/3nzvgNpeq2Q)). These answers, however, are hidden to the model. At the end of each learning cycle ([epoch](https://www.wsj.com/articles/every-closing-curtain-is-not-the-end-of-an-era-11584025672)) the answers that the algorithm comes up with are compared to the actual answers, and the difference in accuracy (or a similar metric) is measured.

The established baseline is the alpha and omega of supervised learning. The  computer will never come up with answers that it has not been taught. But what happens if we were to take the human baseline out of the [loop](https://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/hell/camus.html)?  This process is called: [unsupervised learning](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/unsupervised-learning.html). In the remainder, I'll only focus clustering – a specific application of unsupervised learning – but the underlying principles hold for other techniques too. 

## Low-Fidelity

Unsupervised learning is [amoral](https://librivox.org/search?title=Beyond+Good+and+Evil&author=Nietzsche&reader=&keywords=&genre_id=0&status=all&project_type=either&recorded_language=&sort_order=catalog_date&search_page=1&search_form=advanced): there is no right and wrong. In fact, there is not even a clearly defined set of problems or questions; just data points. These data points are converted to [vectors](https://image420.com/what-is-vector-art/), which for the course of this explanation, are best thought of as [coordinates](https://youtu.be/mgx0kT5UbKk). A unsupervised learning algorithm simply measures the distance between the coordinates before it groups them in clusters on the basis of their [proximity](https://www.sciencealert.com/who-is-no-longer-using-the-phrase-social-distancing) to each other.

The classic use-case for this form of unsupervised learning is in marketing. Where marketeers used to work with [user personae](https://buffer.com/library/marketing-personas-beginners-guide), imaginary models of how their different customers look like and behave. Machine learning turned this process upside down. Instead of defining the [models](http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/autofiction2/hoogstad.html) upfront, it discovers clusters of customers that are present in the data. While this was bad news for the story tellers amongst the marketeers, this cluster based targeting turned out to be much more effective… although occasional [happy 
accidents](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/) do occur, of course.

In marketing, the benefits of unsupervised learnings are easy to sell. Simply because the human baseline is of less importance than another measurable goal: the [bottom line](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/sports/tennis/29agassi.html). In other domains, we are often less inclined to believe that computers can come up with better conclusions than us. 

Just imagine the following:

* The music of Johan Sebastian Bach has more similarities to that of Justin
  Bieber than to that of [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVikZ8Oe_XA)

* The most effective way to solve the [climate crisis](http://www.unescoetxea.org/ext/manual_EDS/pdf/13_riqueza_ingles.pdf) is the global redistribution of wealth

* President Trump only [tweets](https://www.tweetbinder.com/blog/trump-twitter/) proven facts

* The earth is in fact [flat](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8676809/flat-earthers-trip-antarctica-planet-round/)

These findings are, of course, made up – although I believe at least one of them to be true. They are here to illustrate the following point: are  we willing to accept the superiority of an algorithm when its conclusions are [counter](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290169162_Saliency_Scale_and_Information_Towards_a_Unifying_Theory) to our own observations, opinions or beliefs? In other words, are we capable of dropping the human baseline? Lower our voice to make room for better ones?

We should!

Machine Learning does not need to repeat and hollow out human intelligence. It should be used to explore new and better ways to be intelligent. The only thing it needs to unleash its full potential is our permission to [drop the baseline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscript_and_superscript).
