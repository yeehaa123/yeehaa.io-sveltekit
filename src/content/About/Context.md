[Yeehaa](../About.md), alias of [Jan Hein Hoogstad](../About.md), believes the way we build *ecosystems* is broken.

15 years ago he was an established *philosophy professor* and on the side a passionate developer.

These two worlds are both very free thinking and at the same time collaborating in a very structured way to achieve a goal or reach a strong conclusion, with little to no hierarchy.

However when it came to the *ecosystem* that was supposed to empower students to learn better, he was very disappointed.

* Students had to follow the rules, classes and assignments.
* Most professors were not willing to change the rules to adapt to different times.
* And a strong centralized hierarchy brought change to a complete Mexican standoff, where none of the faculties was willing to be the first.

Unfortunately also many companies, still expect innovation and change In the same way.
