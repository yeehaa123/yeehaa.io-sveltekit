title: False Media
published_on: 2020-04-02
excerpt: |
  Fake news is often treated as a property of information. However on a content
  level facts and lies are now mostly impossible to distinguish. In this post, I
  argue that we should bypass this problem by focusing on the agent rather than
  on the news.

Through the miracles of the [early internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LzyRcLJdlg), I discovered the [Weekly
World News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_World_News) while I was in high
school.  Journalism never was the same to me again. Why
[read](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49985/where-are-they-now-8-things-terrified-us-90s)
about the horrors of acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer, when there was
a newspaper that covered sightings of Marilyn Monroe and [Bat
Boy](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gdkwv/an-interview-with-the-creator-of-bat-boy-987)
instead?

Obviously, my own journalistic endeavors had to follow suit. Being the 
editor-in-chief of the school newspaper, I started to take inspiration from my
newly discovered favorite news source. Why stick to the bare facts when they can
be infused with all the wonderful rumors and anecdotes that are floating
around? Isn't [good fiction](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3ADead_Souls_-_A_Poem_by_Nikolay_Gogol_-_vol1.djvu/165) worth more than the boring truth?

My piece de resistance: a [Dear
Mary](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/dear-mary-your-problems-solved) item
that featured letters from the teaching staff. Our Mary — named Hans
— gave the English teacher some much needed tough love about his financial
problems, but was also warm and understanding when the Gym teacher opened up
about his sexual frustrations. [Generoso Pope
Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generoso_Pope_Jr.) would have been proud.

Alas, the dean was of a different opinion. After two marvelous issues, I was
forcefully removed from my post. 

Although I was clearly not amused by his actions at the time, in retrospect, I
would argue that the dean handled the problem of fake news in an exemplary
manner. The key to his success: his actions were not focused on the news itself,
but on the agent that spread it.

For [Planet B](https://planet-b.eu/), I am in the process of turning the dean
into an algorithm. On an abstract level, the steps that it consists of look
like this:

1. Associate a concrete piece of information to a particular agent.

1. Adjust the reputation score of this agent according to the quality of its
   contribution (post, comment, like, etc.).

1. Amplify or quieten the reach of the contribution based on the agent's reputation score.

1. Remove the agent from discourse if its reputation drops below a treshhold.

The aim of such a [Organic

System is to improve the quality of the conversations within our online
community. By turning our channels from a
[cacaphony](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cacophony) into a
working
