To me, the clearest example of a successful business ecosystem remains *Nespresso*.

Nespresso's ecosystem emerged from a tiny but crucial innovation: the capsule. Traditionally, the software (ground beans) and hardware (coffee makers) side of the coffee industry had been fully separated. 

The capsule allowed Nestlé – Nespresso's parent company – to get a hold on the hardware side without entering itself.

And because the capsule and its interface were patented, other manufacturers could not make Nespresso-compatible machines without permission.” [HBR](https://hbr.org/2019/09/in-the-ecosystem-economy-whats-your-strategy)

In short: the invention of the capsule allowed Nespresso to create an ecosystem of manufacturers and suppliers around its ground coffee beans. The Nespresso capsule functioned, as I would like to call it, as a *vessel of transformation*. 

A vessel of transformation is an innovative concept, format, or product that aligns the interest of otherwise misaligned stakeholders

Like the Nespresso capsule, vessels of transformation have to be deliberately designed. They require deep knowledge of the *critical challenge* that they solve, and the interest of the stakeholders whose interests it aligns. 

If successful, however, the resulting *ecosystem plays* are commonly [blue ocean strategies](../../Notes/Blue%20Ocean%20Strategy.md). They don't compete on existing markets, but substantially expand them or even create entirely new ones.
